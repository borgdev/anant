The holder of an ADR has the right to obtain the underlying foreign security that the ADR represents, but investors usually find it more convenient to own the ADR. The price of an ADR generally tracks the price of the foreign security in its home market, adjusted for the ratio of ADRs to foreign company shares. In the case of companies domiciled in the United Kingdom, creation of ADRs attracts a 1.5 percent creation fee; this creation fee is different than stamp duty reserve tax charge by the UK government.
