Consequently, common shareholders' funds are the basis on which most market judgements of capital adequacy are made. The voting rights attached to common stock also provide an important source of market discipline over a bank's management. For these reasons, voting common shareholders' equity and the disclosed reserves or retained earnings that accrue to the shareholders' benefit should be the predominant form of a bank's Tier 1 capital.\n\t\tPotential regulatory adjustments (e.g., fees, commissions, valuation adjustments) are defined in paragraphs 66-90 of the Basel III rules text."

The key aspects of short selling restrictions in the EU include: (1) Temporary Short Selling Bans: ESMA or national competent authorities (NCAs) can impose temporary short selling bans on specific stocks or all stocks in response to significant market declines or to prevent disorderly markets. These bans can last up to three months but can be renewed if necessary. (2) Restrictions During Market Stress: Similar to the SEC's alternative uptick rule, the EU SSR allows for restrictions when a significant price drop occurs. If a stock drops by 10% or more within a single day, NCAs can impose a temporary short selling ban on that stock for the remainder of the day. (3) Notification and Disclosure: Market participants are required to notify NCAs if their net short positions in a company reach or exceed 0.2% of the company's issued share capital. Additional disclosures are required at each 0.1% increment above the initial threshold. (4) Prohibition of Naked Short Selling: The regulation prohibits naked short selling, requiring that short sellers must have either borrowed the securities or have an arrangement in place to borrow them before the sale is executed. These regulations are designed to enhance market transparency, reduce risks associated with short selling, and prevent market abuse during periods of significant market stress. Specific details and updates can be found on the ESMA website or through the relevant NCA for each EU member state."
