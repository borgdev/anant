These codes facilitate information lookup across various financial networks. The concept of RICs traces back to the Quotron service, which Thomson Reuters acquired in the 1980s. The division was spun out as Refinitiv in 2018. Refinitiv was acquired by the London Stock Exchange Group in 2021, and the organization was rebranded as LSEG Financial Solutions in 2023, though the name of the code and certain other branded concepts were retained."
