In its most basic form, a CDS is a contract where a 'protection buyer' agrees to make periodic payments (the CDS 'spread' or premium) over a predetermined number of years (the maturity or term of the CDS) to a 'protection seller' in exchange for a payment from the protection seller in the event of default by a 'reference entity.' CDS premiums tend to be paid quarterly and are set as a percentage of the total amount of protection bought (the 'notional amount' of the contract). CDS maturities generally range from one to ten years, with the five-year maturity being particularly common.\" See https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2022023pap.pdf for more detail.",
