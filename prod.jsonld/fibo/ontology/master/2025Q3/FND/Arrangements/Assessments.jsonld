This reflects the collective assessment of investors and market participants.\n- Shareholder Value: The financial returns that shareholders receive from owning a company's stock, including dividends and capital gains.\n- Brand Value: The premium that customers are willing to pay for a product or service due to the brand's reputation, recognition, and loyalty.\n\nOverall, value in business is about creating and capturing benefits that meet the needs and expectations of various stakeholders, from customers to investors."
