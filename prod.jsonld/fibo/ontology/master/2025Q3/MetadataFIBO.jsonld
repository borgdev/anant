    "@value" : "The Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO) is a collaborative effort among industry practitioners, semantic technology experts and information scientists to standardize the language used to precisely define the terms, conditions, and characteristics of financial instruments; the legal and relationship structure of business entities; the content and time dimensions of market data; and the legal obligations and process aspects of corporate actions. The definitions and relationships that comprise FIBO have been modularized into a number of domains, which in turn include a number of modules, each of which is further modularized into one or more constituent ontologies. \n\nThe FIBO ontologies are available for download as OWL 2 DL compliant ontologies from the EDM Council site in three serializations: RDF/XML, Turtle, and JSON-LD, and are linked at https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/. They can also be downloaded directly from GitHub at https://github.com/edmcouncil/fibo."
