These roles are defined in terms of the types of control enjoyed by the party, for example de facto or de jure control. An important feature of this ontology is the distinction between the holding of a controlling interest (such as voting shares), and the de facto existence of control of one body by another as asserted in company filings or as a conclusion drawn from computational analysis of controlling interests."
