## 🕐 Time Series as Cyclic Manifolds

### **The Geometric View**

**Traditional**: Time series = sequence of values  
**Geometric**: Time series = **closed geodesic on a manifold**

### **Key Insights**

1. **Periodicity = Closed Geodesic**
```
Daily cycle → Geodesic returns to starting point
Seasonality → Longer-period closed geodesic
Trend → Geodesic with non-zero winding number
```

2. **Anomalies = Curvature Spikes**
```
Normal behavior → Smooth curvature
Anomaly → Sudden curvature change
Outlier → Off the geodesic
```

3. **Forecasting = Geodesic Extension**
```
Past data → Geodesic trajectory
Future → Continue along geodesic
Uncertainty → Geodesic spray
```

4. **Correlation = Parallel Geodesics**
```
Correlated series → Parallel geodesics
Lead/lag → Phase shift in geodesic
Causation → One geodesic determines another's curvature
```

### **Implementation**

```python
from geometry.domains import TimeSeriesManifold

# Create temporal manifold
ts_manifold = TimeSeriesManifold(time_series_data)

# Detect cycles (closed geodesics)
cycles = ts_manifold.find_closed_geodesics()
# Returns: [(period=24, confidence=0.95), (period=168, confidence=0.88)]

# Find anomalies (curvature spikes)
anomalies = ts_manifold.detect_curvature_anomalies()
# High curvature = anomaly in time!

# Forecast (extend geodesic)
forecast = ts_manifold.geodesic_forecast(steps=10)
# Natural continuation along the manifold

# Seasonality (periodic curvature)
seasonality = ts_manifold.curvature_periodicity()
# Curvature itself has cycles!
