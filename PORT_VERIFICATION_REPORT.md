# Current Port Usage Verification

## Currently Active Services and Ports

Based on `docker compose ps` and `ss -tlnp` analysis:

### ✅ WORKING SERVICES

| Service | Container | External Port | Internal Port | Status |
|---------|-----------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| PostgreSQL (Unified) | anant-postgres | 5454 | 5432 | ✅ Healthy |
| Redis Cache | anant-cache | 6380 | 6379 | ✅ Healthy |

### ❌ FAILING SERVICES

| Service | Container | Expected External Ports | Status | Issue |
|---------|-----------|-------------------------|---------|--------|
| Ray Head (Production) | anant-ray-head | 9094, 8285, 10001 | ❌ Restarting | Command parsing error |

## Port Mappings Analysis

### Production Profile (what SHOULD be working):
```yaml
anant-ray-head:
  ports:
    - "9094:8000"    # Anant Enterprise API
    - "8285:8265"    # Ray Dashboard  
    - "10001:10001"  # Ray cluster communication
```

### Development Profile (from your selection):
```yaml
anant-ray-head-dev:
  ports:
    - "9095:8000"    # Anant Enterprise API (different port for dev)
    - "8286:8265"    # Ray Dashboard (different port for dev)
    - "10002:10001"  # Ray cluster communication
```

## Current Issues

1. **Ray Head Container**: Failing due to shell command parsing issues
   - Ray itself starts successfully
   - Shell cannot parse the multi-line YAML command format
   - Python script fails to execute

2. **Ports Not Accessible**:
   - ❌ 9094 (Production API)
   - ❌ 8285 (Production Ray Dashboard)
   - ❌ 10001 (Production Ray Communication)
   - ❌ 9095 (Development API)  
   - ❌ 8286 (Development Ray Dashboard)
   - ❌ 10002 (Development Ray Communication)

## Network Connectivity Test Results

```bash
# Working ports:
✅ 5454 - PostgreSQL: Connection succeeded
✅ 6380 - Redis: Connection succeeded

# Not accessible (services not running):
❌ 9094 - Ray API: Connection refused
❌ 8285 - Ray Dashboard: Connection refused
❌ 9095 - Ray Dev API: Connection refused  
❌ 8286 - Ray Dev Dashboard: Connection refused
```

## Profile Usage Status

| Profile | Status | Services Running | Ports Active |
|---------|--------|------------------|--------------|
| production | ⚠️ Partial | postgres, cache | 5454, 6380 |
| development | ❌ Not started | postgres-dev | 5456 (not started) |
| registry | ⚠️ Partial | postgres, cache | 5454, 6380 |
| monitoring | ❌ Not started | none | none |

## Next Steps to Fix

1. Fix Ray container command parsing issue
2. Start Ray services properly to expose ports:
   - 9094, 8285, 10001 (production)
   - 9095, 8286, 10002 (development)
3. Test registry API (port 9096)
4. Verify all services are accessible

## Port Configuration Summary

The Docker Compose file is configured correctly with the intended ports:
- **PostgreSQL**: 5454 ✅ (working)
- **Redis**: 6380 ✅ (working)  
- **Ray Production**: 9094, 8285, 10001 ❌ (not working due to container failure)
- **Ray Development**: 9095, 8286, 10002 ❌ (not started)
- **Registry API**: 9096 ❌ (not started)

The port assignments follow industry best practices and avoid conflicts, but the services need to be running to expose them.
