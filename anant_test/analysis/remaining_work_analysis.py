Remaining Work Analysis - Post Enhanced SetSystems & Advanced Properties

Now that we've completed the critical production blockers, let's identify:
1. Remaining gaps from original plan
2. Nice-to-have enhancements  
3. Additional opportunities for improvement
4. Prioritized roadmap for continued development

This analysis accounts for our recent major completions.
