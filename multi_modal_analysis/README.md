# Multi-Modal Relationship Analysis for Anant

## 🎯 Overview

This module implements **multi-modal relationship analysis** capabilities for the Anant hypergraph library, enabling cross-domain insights by analyzing multiple relationship types simultaneously.

## 📊 What is Multi-Modal Analysis?

Multi-modal analysis examines entities that participate in multiple types of relationships (modalities) simultaneously. This enables:

- **Cross-Domain Pattern Discovery**: Find patterns that span multiple relationship types
- **Inter-Modal Influence**: Understand how activity in one domain affects another
- **Holistic Entity Analysis**: Complete view of entities across all their relationships
- **Hidden Relationship Detection**: Discover implicit connections through modal bridging

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from multi_modal_analysis import MultiModalHypergraph

# Create multi-modal hypergraph
mmhg = MultiModalHypergraph()

# Add different modalities (relationship types)
mmhg.add_modality("purchases", purchase_hypergraph)
mmhg.add_modality("reviews", review_hypergraph)
mmhg.add_modality("wishlists", wishlist_hypergraph)

# Analyze cross-modal patterns
patterns = mmhg.detect_cross_modal_patterns()

# Compute multi-modal centrality
centrality = mmhg.compute_cross_modal_centrality(
    node_id="customer_123",
    aggregation="weighted_average"
)

# Find inter-modal relationships
relationships = mmhg.discover_inter_modal_relationships(
    source_modality="purchases",
    target_modality="reviews"
)
```

## 📚 Use Cases

### 1. E-Commerce Customer Analysis
**Modalities**: Purchases, Reviews, Wishlists, Returns, Support Tickets

**Insights**:
- Customers who review but never purchase
- Products frequently wishlisted but rarely bought
- High-value customers with many returns
- Review patterns vs purchase patterns

### 2. Healthcare Patient Journeys
**Modalities**: Treatments, Diagnoses, Providers, Medications, Lab Results

**Insights**:
- Treatment effectiveness across patient populations
- Provider coordination patterns
- Medication interaction networks
- Diagnostic pathway optimization

### 3. Academic Research Networks
**Modalities**: Citations, Collaborations, Funding, Mentorship, Publications

**Insights**:
- Researchers who collaborate without citing
- Funding impact on collaboration patterns
- Mentor-mentee publication trajectories
- Cross-institutional research clusters

### 4. Social Media Behavior
**Modalities**: Posts, Likes, Shares, Comments, Follows, Messages

**Insights**:
- Engagement patterns across content types
- Influence propagation mechanisms
- Community formation dynamics
- Content virality factors

## 🔧 Key Features

### Cross-Modal Pattern Detection
```python
# Find entities that bridge multiple modalities
bridges = mmhg.find_modal_bridges(
    min_modalities=3,
    min_connections=5
)

# Detect anomalous cross-modal behavior
anomalies = mmhg.detect_cross_modal_anomalies(
    method="isolation_forest",
    contamination=0.1
)
```

### Multi-Modal Centrality Metrics
```python
# Aggregate centrality across modalities
centrality = mmhg.multi_modal_centrality(
    metric="degree",
    aggregation="weighted_sum",
    weights={"purchases": 2.0, "reviews": 1.0}
)

# Compare centrality across modalities
comparison = mmhg.compare_modal_centralities(
    node_id="entity_123",
    metric="betweenness"
)
```

### Inter-Modal Relationship Discovery
```python
# Find implicit connections through modalities
implicit = mmhg.discover_implicit_relationships(
    source_nodes=["customer_1", "customer_2"],
    bridging_modalities=["purchases", "reviews"]
)

# Measure modal correlation
correlation = mmhg.compute_modal_correlation(
    modality_a="purchases",
    modality_b="reviews",
    method="jaccard"
)
```

### Temporal Multi-Modal Analysis
```python
# Track modal activity over time
evolution = mmhg.analyze_temporal_evolution(
    time_windows=["2024-01", "2024-02", "2024-03"],
    modalities=["purchases", "reviews"]
)

# Detect modal transition patterns
transitions = mmhg.detect_modal_transitions(
    sequence_length=3,
    min_support=10
)
```

## 🎯 Gap Addressed

**After**: Production-ready multi-modal analysis capabilities

**Missing Features Now Implemented**:
- ✅ Multi-modal hypergraph construction
- ✅ Cross-modal pattern detection
- ✅ Inter-modal relationship discovery
- ✅ Multi-modal centrality metrics
- ✅ Modal correlation analysis
- ✅ Cross-modal anomaly detection
- ✅ Temporal multi-modal tracking

## 🧪 Testing

Run comprehensive tests:
```bash
pytest multi_modal_analysis/tests/ -v
```

## 🤝 Integration with Anant Core

This module seamlessly integrates with Anant's core hypergraph library:

```python
from anant import Hypergraph
from multi_modal_analysis import MultiModalHypergraph

# Create individual hypergraphs using Anant core
purchases_hg = Hypergraph(purchase_data)
reviews_hg = Hypergraph(review_data)

# Combine into multi-modal analysis
mmhg = MultiModalHypergraph()
mmhg.add_modality("purchases", purchases_hg)
mmhg.add_modality("reviews", reviews_hg)

# Analyze cross-domain insights
insights = mmhg.generate_cross_modal_insights()
```

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

- **Memory Efficiency**: Each modality stored separately, loaded on-demand
- **Computational Complexity**: O(k×n) for k modalities and n nodes
- **Scalability**: Handles millions of entities across dozens of modalities
- **Optimization**: Lazy evaluation and caching for expensive operations

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- [ ] GPU acceleration for large-scale cross-modal analysis
- [ ] Distributed processing for enterprise-scale modalities
- [ ] Advanced ML-based pattern detection
- [ ] Interactive visualization of cross-modal networks
- [ ] AutoML for modal relationship prediction
