# ANANT Library Improvements Analysis

Based on our comprehensive FIBO financial ontology analysis, this document identifies key improvements for the ANANT library to better support enterprise-scale knowledge graph analytics.

**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-18  
**Dataset:** FIBO Financial Industry Business Ontology  
**Scale:** 50,019 nodes, 128,445 edges, 385,335 incidences

## üö® CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS IDENTIFIED

### 1. Algorithm Stability & Completeness

**Issues Found:**
- Clustering algorithms have bugs (missing `edge_column`/`node_column` attributes)
- Pattern detection algorithms incomplete
- Limited centrality measures beyond basic degree centrality

**Proposed Improvements:**
- Fix IncidenceStore interface consistency

- Pattern-based subgraph extraction
- Shortest hyperpath algorithms
- Domain-specific filtering

### 7. Incremental Analytics

**Need Identified:**
- Large ontologies change over time
- Need incremental update capabilities
- Delta analysis for ontology evolution

**Proposed Improvements:**
- Incremental algorithm updates
- Ontology version comparison
- Change impact analysis
- Temporal analytics

### 8. Enterprise Integration

**Gaps Found:**
- No streaming analytics support
