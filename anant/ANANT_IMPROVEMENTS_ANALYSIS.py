# ========================================
# CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS IDENTIFIED
# ========================================

## 1. ALGORITHM STABILITY & COMPLETENESS
### Issues Found:
- Clustering algorithms have bugs (missing edge_column/node_column attributes)
- Pattern detection algorithms incomplete
- Limited centrality measures beyond basic degree centrality

### Proposed Improvements:
```python
# Fix clustering algorithms
class IncidenceStore:
    @property
    def edge_column(self):
        return 'edge_id'
    
    @property 
    def node_column(self):
        return 'node_id'

# Add more centrality measures
def betweenness_centrality(hypergraph): pass
def closeness_centrality(hypergraph): pass
def eigenvector_centrality(hypergraph): pass

# Robust clustering
def hierarchical_clustering(hypergraph): pass
def spectral_clustering(hypergraph): pass
```

## 2. ONTOLOGY-SPECIFIC ANALYTICS
### Gap Identified:
- No specialized support for RDF/OWL ontologies
- Missing semantic relationship analysis
- No domain-specific pattern recognition

### Proposed Improvements:
```python
# New module: anant.ontology
class OntologyAnalyzer:
    def analyze_rdf_patterns(self, hypergraph):
        """Detect RDF triple patterns"""
        pass
    
    def extract_class_hierarchies(self, hypergraph):
        """Find rdfs:subClassOf relationships"""
        pass
    
    def identify_property_domains(self, hypergraph):
        """Analyze property domain/range patterns"""
        pass

class DomainAnalyzer:
    def analyze_financial_patterns(self, hypergraph):
        """FIBO-specific analysis"""
        pass
```

## 3. SAMPLING & PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
### Issue Found:
- Had to manually sample data for performance (2k-5k nodes)
- No built-in intelligent sampling strategies
- Missing progressive analysis capabilities

### Proposed Improvements:
```python
class SmartSampler:
    def stratified_sample(self, hypergraph, sample_size, strategy='degree'):
        """Intelligent sampling preserving graph properties"""
        pass
    
    def progressive_analysis(self, hypergraph, max_nodes=10000):
        """Automatically determine optimal sample size"""
        pass

# Enhanced performance monitoring
@performance_monitor(auto_sample=True, max_nodes=5000)
def large_scale_centrality(hypergraph):
    pass
```

## 4. SPECIALIZED FINANCIAL ANALYTICS
### Gap Identified:
- No financial domain-specific algorithms
- Missing risk analysis capabilities
- No regulatory compliance analytics

### Proposed Improvements:
```python
# New module: anant.finance
class FinancialAnalytics:
    def risk_propagation_analysis(self, hypergraph):
        """Analyze risk spread through financial networks"""
        pass
    
    def regulatory_compliance_check(self, hypergraph, regulations):
        """Check compliance patterns"""
        pass
    
    def market_structure_analysis(self, hypergraph):
        """Analyze market connectivity patterns"""
        pass
```

## 5. ENHANCED REPORTING & VISUALIZATION
### Limitation Found:
- Basic text reports only
- No interactive visualization
- Limited export formats

### Proposed Improvements:
```python
# Enhanced reporting
class AdvancedReporter:
    def generate_interactive_report(self, analysis_results):
        """HTML with interactive charts"""
        pass
    
    def export_to_formats(self, results, formats=['pdf', 'excel', 'json']):
        """Multi-format export"""
        pass

# Visualization support
class HypergraphVisualizer:
    def plot_degree_distribution(self, hypergraph): pass
    def visualize_domain_structure(self, hypergraph): pass
    def create_centrality_heatmap(self, centrality_results): pass
```

## 6. QUERY & SUBGRAPH EXTRACTION
### Gap Identified:
- No advanced querying capabilities
- Limited subgraph extraction by patterns
- Missing path analysis

### Proposed Improvements:
```python
class HypergraphQuery:
    def find_patterns(self, pattern_template):
        """SPARQL-like querying for hypergraphs"""
        pass
    
    def extract_domain_subgraph(self, domain_filter):
        """Extract domain-specific subgraphs"""
        pass
    
    def find_shortest_hyperpaths(self, source, target):
        """Path analysis in hypergraphs"""
        pass
```

## 7. INCREMENTAL ANALYTICS
### Need Identified:
- Large ontologies change over time
- Need incremental update capabilities
- Delta analysis for ontology evolution

### Proposed Improvements:
```python
class IncrementalAnalyzer:
    def update_analysis(self, old_results, new_hypergraph):
        """Update analytics without full recomputation"""
        pass
    
    def compare_ontology_versions(self, hg1, hg2):
        """Analyze changes between ontology versions"""
        pass
```

## 8. ENTERPRISE INTEGRATION
### Gaps Found:
- No streaming analytics support
- Limited integration with knowledge graph stores
- Missing enterprise authentication/authorization

### Proposed Improvements:
```python
# Streaming analytics
class StreamingAnalyzer:
    def process_ontology_stream(self, rdf_stream):
        """Real-time ontology analysis"""
        pass

# Enterprise connectors
class EnterpriseConnectors:
    def connect_to_stardog(self, config): pass
    def connect_to_neo4j(self, config): pass
    def connect_to_virtuoso(self, config): pass
```
